Hello, World

![Scary!](/images/prettydog.jpg "Beautiful Doggo")

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon. I am majoring in biology, with minors in CIT and chemistry. I love the outdoors, riding bikes, hiking, swimming, playing games, and spending time with my friends and loved ones. I am very interested in the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria and their interaction with humans in the future.

Some of my CIT 281 Projects!
